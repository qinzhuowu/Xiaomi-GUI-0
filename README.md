## 📰 News

- **2026-06** — 🚀 Released the **Xiaomi-GUI-0** [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31410), code, and evaluation suites.
- **2026-06** — 🧪 Released [**RealMobile**](https://github.com/SeerRay-Lab/Xiaomi-GUI-0/tree/main/RealMobile), a real-device benchmark across 14 live apps with sub-goal scoring.
- **2026-06** — 🌐 Launched the [project page](https://seerray-lab.github.io/Xiaomi-GUI-0/) and the [HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/SeerRay-Lab/xiaomi-gui-0).

## ✨ What Is Xiaomi-GUI-0?

High benchmark scores do not reliably predict performance on real devices, where account states, permission dialogs, payment authentication, and risk-control mechanisms continually reshape the state distribution a GUI agent encounters. To close this gap, **Xiaomi-GUI-0** is a native end-to-end multimodal GUI agent for real mobile environments, trained and evaluated within a **real-device closed loop**:

- **📱 Real-device-dominant infrastructure**: hundreds of physical phones, tablets, and in-vehicle cockpits, complemented by sandboxes, so collection, training, and evaluation share one real-deployment distribution.
- **🔁 Error-driven data flywheel**: failure trajectories from real rollouts are converted into corrected actions, reflective rationales, and recovery demonstrations.
- **🎯 Progressive three-stage training**: SFT → Step RL → Agentic RL incrementally builds basic interface operation, long-horizon planning, and error recovery.
- **🧪 RealMobile benchmark**: 100 real-device tasks across 14 live apps, scored by fine-grained sub-goals, with 57% spanning multiple applications.

## 🧪 The RealMobile Benchmark

RealMobile is built from real user traffic, hand-crafted for reproducible evaluation, and executed on **physical devices against live applications** rather than emulators. Each task is scored through **fine-grained sub-goals** that award partial credit, and most tasks span **multiple applications**.

| Domain | Tasks | Avg. Apps | Multi-App Ratio | Focus |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Foundation | 10 | 1.30 | 10% | Basic GUI operations: clicking, scrolling, inputting, and navigating across interfaces. |
| Safety & Reflection | 16 | 1.31 | 31% | Refusing unsafe or irreversible operations, and recognizing infeasible goals to stop or skip. |
| Memory & Knowledge | 33 | 1.73 | 58% | Retaining information across steps and applying external knowledge to complete tasks. |
| Complex Reasoning & Planning | 41 | 2.49 | 78% | Long-horizon planning, multi-source aggregation, and adaptive decision-making. |
| **Overall** | **100** | **1.93** | **57%** | |

## 🗂️ Repository Layout

The agent is shipped as a product and evaluated by two complementary benchmarks. Each directory has its own README with full setup and usage.

| Directory | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`guiness/`](guiness/) | **Desktop client** that runs the agent on a real phone. PySide6 application with a Kotlin Android companion; connects over WiFi (no ADB) or USB; interactive GUI plus a batch evaluation runner. |
| [`android_world_eval/`](android_world_eval/) | **Dynamic emulator benchmark** built on AndroidWorld. The agent sees screenshots only (no accessibility tree); 116 tasks across 20 applications, with checkpoint and resume. |
| [`RealMobile/`](RealMobile/) | **Real-phone Chinese-application benchmark.** Scores recorded trajectories by fine-grained sub-goals, verified with XPath and code rules over the UI hierarchy XML, with PaddleOCR for on-screen text. |
| [`demo/`](demo/) | **Sample trajectories.** A few AndroidWorld episodes (`task.json` plus per-turn screenshots). Data only, no code. |
